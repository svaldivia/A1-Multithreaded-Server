Description
-------------------

This repo contains a multithreaded server using pThreads and a client to test its operations.

Server:
- Run the server using: ./mtserver <num_client_connections> <port_number>
Operations:
-Load: Returns number of connections
-Add: Returns the addition of the provided numbers
-Uptime: Returns the server uptime (Not working at the moment)

Client:
-Run the client using: ./client <client_host>
-Operations are hard coded in the client, this is mainly to test the functionality of the server.

testclient.py:
-TA provided client that I modified for testing my server.
-In general, it was to test the server faster than with client.c


My implementation of multithreaded server and the test client was based on the following
tutorials:
